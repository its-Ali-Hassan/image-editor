# 🚀 JavaScript Image Editor – Updated Version



I’ve updated my **Image Editor project** and added **LocalStorage support** so progress doesn’t disappear anymore.



🔗 **Live Demo**: [https://its-ali-hassan.github.io/image-editor](https://its-ali-hassan.github.io/image-editor)

📂 **GitHub Repo**: [https://github.com/its-Ali-Hassan/image-editor.git](https://github.com/its-Ali-Hassan/image-editor.git)



##### 🔑 What this project does:



* Upload and edit images in the browser
* Apply filters using **JavaScript**
* Image + filter state is saved using **LocalStorage**
* Image stays even after **page reload**
* Built with **HTML, CSS, Vanilla JS**



##### ⚠️ Limitations:



* Optimized for **laptop screens only**
* Not responsive for mobile/tablet yet



##### 📈 What I learned:



* How **LocalStorage** works in real projects
* Managing image state in the browser
* Stronger understanding of **DOM \& events**



###### **Next goals**:



* Make it fully responsive
* Improve UI/UX
* Add more advanced filters
